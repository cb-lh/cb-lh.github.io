<h4 style="text-align:center">Local Veteran Honored</h4>
<p >Highland Park American Legion Post #206 Commander David Bloom was honored on June 25 as Veteran of the Year for California Assembly District 51 at a luncheon event at the State Capitol.<br>
Born at Kaiser Hospital on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood in 1969, Mr. Bloom was raised in Northeast Los Angeles and attended Latona Avenue Elementary, Area 7 Alternative, Nightingale, Mount Gleason, and Luther Burbank Junior High Schools. He attended both Lincoln High school and Highland Park’s Franklin High School. Bloom enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve in 1990, served stateside during Operation Desert Storm, and left the Marines in 1996. He graduated CSULA in 1997 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Broadcasting.<br>

After the terrorist attacks of 9/11, Bloom enlisted in the Army Reserve on March 31, 2003. He served in Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom as a Civil Affairs Sergeant in southwest Baghdad from 2005 to 2006.<br>

Bloom joined the volunteers of American Legion Post 206 in Highland Park in 1999 and was elected Post Commander in 2004. He has served as Post 206 Commander for eight of the past nine years; the exception being the year he served in Iraq. “I am extremely honored by the recognition” Bloom says. “I spoke with Assemblymember Gomez literally in the Capitol elevator about developing legislation that would make it a hate crime to target veterans and service members for crimes.” The result? “He seems extremely interested in reaching out to the veteran community,” said Bloom.</p><br>
