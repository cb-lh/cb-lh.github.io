<h4 style="text-align:center">Vergara Case’s Real Motive</h4>
<p >

By El Gabacho<br>

On June 10th,Judge Treu cited research on “teacher quality and effectiveness”  in the Vergara v. California case and ruled three areas of state statutes unconstitutional: 1) teacher permanent employment status, 2) teacher dismissal procedures, and 3) teacher layoff by seniority.
The real motive of the case is to cut the budget by attacking tenured teachers at the top of the salary scale.  Students’ right to an education has nothing to do with why teacher tenure and seniority are under attack. Corporate interests behind this lawsuit want to destroy a professional teaching force solely for the motive of profit to more hedge fund run charters.<br>

If “teacher quality and effectiveness” and the best education for students were really the issues, ensuring an environment of reasonable discipline, while eliminating social promotion would have been implemented long ago. Many students enter behind and are never brought up to grade-level.  Clearly this is the recipe for the disaster, which has nothing to do with teacher seniority.  Unfortunately, many teachers who insist on excellence, have been systematically targeted over the last 5 years, have sat in teacher jail brought up on fabricated charges, and have been removed or forced into early retirement.<br>

The Vergara case purposefully ignores that Average Daily Attendance (ADA) payments from the state are more valued than whether or not students achieve.  It also ignores the high drop-out rate.<br>

What is the cost of many new teachers quitting LAUSD within their first 5 years of teaching? Why are they quitting? If the students were really the concern in Vergara, wouldn’t those financing it try to find out why so many initially dedicated teachers leave the profession?<br>

This scam would not be possible without the complicity of the media, owned by the same players trying to privatize public education. Charitable trusts like Eli Broad, Bill Gates, and the Waltons even control NPR to the point where NPR will report nothing to contradict what Diane Ravitch calls “the dominant narrative of bad teachers and great charters.”  What is ultimately at stake is allowing the public school budget to go for “charter administration costs,” while allowing the further dumbing down of our future citizens.<br>
