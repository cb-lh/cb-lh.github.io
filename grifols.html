These programs prepare individuals for the pharmaceutical industry as well as for manufacturing jobs in the refinery, waste water, and sanitation industries. Willie notes, “I call upon our business leaders to become more involved and ensure that we are supporting the amazing talent that we have in our local community.”  Recently, he joined efforts to back the GO East Los Angeles initiative to increase college awareness, preparation, and access with a guaranteed pathway to college completion.<br>
