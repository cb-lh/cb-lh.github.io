<p>When Community Beacon Marketing Director George Cabrerra heard that the Lincoln Heights Youth Orchestra needed a place to practice and assistance finding funds to buy instruments, he did what comes naturally to a well-connected member of the community: he promised to spread the word.<br>

 
Said music director Gilberto Torres, “We have been rehearsing with our small orchestra in different locations for a year and a half. Since we are getting bigger (over 30 students) we need a permanent location.” Keeping neighborhood kids involved in a creative practice like a youth orchestra and providing the consistency of a fixed schedule and permanent location produces an environment for healthy growth.<br>

“This type of thing helps children develop good self-esteem and discipline, and they learn to work as a team,” said Mr. Cabrerra, “If that doesn’t enrich our community, I don’t know what does.”<br>

The LHYO program gives all children the opportunity to participate regardless of their economic status, providing professional quality music instruction and the opportunity to perform locally.  If you are a business or property owner who can offer this group some assistance you can contact Mr. Torres directly at lhyo@musician.org  or ph: (562) 505-9771.  The orchestra also welcomes donations to support the purchase of musical instruments.<br>
