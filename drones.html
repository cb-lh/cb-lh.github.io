Nearly a year ago, the Seattle Police Department acquired two Draganflyer X6 drones through a grant from the Department of Homeland Security. Drones, small unmanned aircraft similar to remote control airplanes, have historically been used by the military but are now being used in a small but growing number of civil applications such as policing and firefighting. In a highly fueled public hearing with the Seattle City Council, Seattle residents defended privacy rights and protested police spying, finally compelling the mayor to scrap the program and “gift” the controversial policing tools to the Los Angeles Police Department.<br>

The LAPD’s infrastructure is seeing increased militarization through electronic and human surveillance programs such as Hi Definition Cameras, Automatic License Plate Readers, Suspicious Activity Reporting/Special Order 1, iWATCH, Predictive Policing, and the Safer Cities Initiative. In February, LAPD envoys visited Israel for a “Big Data” conference focusing on drones called “Hovermast” which can be used both for spying and crowd control.<br>

Along with violating our basic human rights, the use of drones has a high potential for destruction of lives and property. As the Washington Post notes, more than 400 US military drones have crashed around the world in the last 13 years, highlighting “a record of calamity that exposes the potential dangers of throwing open [our] skies to drone traffic.”<br>

The Stop LAPD Spying Coalition holds monthly meetings in an attempt to derail this disturbing potential future, The next meeting will be held on August 19th at 675 S. Parkview Ave (across from MacArthur Park). To learn more about the campaign against drones go to www.stoplapdspying.org.<br>
