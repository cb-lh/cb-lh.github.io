<h4 style="text-align:center">Communities Oppose Dump Expansion</h4>
<p >

By Hans Johnson<br>

Thousands of families in Northeast Los Angeles may be exposed to dangerous levels of deadly air pollution, including diesel exhaust, if the city of Glendale’s proposal for a huge expansion of the Scholl Canyon dump is approved. Neighbors surrounding the waste facility and its access road through Eagle Rock are uniting to challenge the plan. <br>

This rare urban dump was slated for closure in 2021. But now Glendale’s plan to enlarge it threatens a garbage high-rise of 180 additional feet, or 14 stories tall, looming over its immediate neighbors. According to the city’s draft environmental impact report, the dump expansion would also impose “significant unavoidable adverse impacts related to air quality” dramatically worsening levels of nitrogen oxide, which contributes to hazardous ozone, as well as fine and coarse particles. <br>

Glendale’s press release on the expansion admits, “Public access is only from Scholl Canyon Road.”  Eagle Rock and Pasadena neighbors downwind from the dump entrance would breathe diesel exhaust from hundreds more dump trucks entering the dump each day. Long-term exposure to that exhaust is dangerous and can be deadly. The Centers for Disease Control have declared diesel exhaust a carcinogen and the American Cancer Society has documented the many risks to humans from exposure to diesel exhaust.<br>

The time to speak out is now. While the Glendale comment period on the dump expansion ends August 31, the East Area Progressive Democratic club is determined to show that dangerous air pollution is NOT “unavoidable.” Working together, we can stop it. Join EAPD in making our communities’ voice heard.<br>

Hans Johnson is president of the East Area Progressive Democrats, at http://eapd.la. The club supports environmental protection, waste reduction, and recycling and opposes environmental health threats. <br>
