Recently elected LA-32 Neighborhood Council Vice President, Attorney Kaprisha LaFaye Cressel-Vallecillo grew up in Compton, California and is proud to serve her community. Ms. Vallecillo, who witnessed the devastating effects of the 1992 Los Angeles riots, knows how detrimental it can been when a community feels justice has not been served. As a result, she works to ensure her community will have effective representation and access to the legal system.<br>

Ms. Vallecillo graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology Inequality; Law and Society from Cornell University, and also received a Master of Public Administration degree with a concentration in Government, Policy, and Politics from Cornell. She went on to receive her Juris Doctor degree from the University of Southern California. <br>

While attending USC Law, Ms. Vallecillo participated in the Employer Legal Advice Clinic and was the Western Regional Champion, Western Regional Best Brief, and National Quarterfinalist in the nationally renowned Frederick Douglas Moot Court Competition. After completing law school, Ms. Vallecillo opened her own firm, Family Matters Legal and Mediation Center, and has been practicing law for three years. More information can be found at www.familymatterslegal.com<br>

Ms. Vallecillo would not have the determination to pursue justice and legal equity without the love and support of her family and friends. She truly appreciates the constant motivation and encouragement of her husband Daniel (married 9 years) and children Joy (7) and Isabella (3).<br>
